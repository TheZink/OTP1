## Localisation Instructions

Currently, the application localisation works by selecting one of 4 language from a drop down menu. These languages include:
- English
- Finnish
- Japanese
- Persian

Language change happens while logging in and will be in effect while using the application. Admins will also see the language change in the adminpanel.

## Localisation Resources
